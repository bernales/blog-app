# blog-app
This blog application was built with Django web framework. It allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The homepage will list all blog posts and there will be a dedicated detail page for each individual blog post. This app includes Bootstrap and CSS for styling. Lastly, the app uses the built-in Django authentication system.
